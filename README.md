# Pokedex App

This project is an online Pokedex application that retrieves data from the PokeAPI. It showcases a list of 150 Pokémon from the API as buttons and allows users to click each button to learn more about the Pokémon.

## Features

- Pokémon Repository: A repository is created using JavaScript to fetch details from the API and display them as button elements.
- Pokémon Details: Clicking a Pokémon button opens a modal designed with Bootstrap, displaying details such as the Pokémon's name, height, weight, and image.

## Technologies Used

### JavaScript ES6

The app's core functionality is written in JavaScript ES6, ensuring compatibility across most browsers and devices.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is utilized for the modals' display and the overall style and responsiveness of the page and its buttons.

### PokeAPI

The PokeAPI is used to retrieve data about the Pokémon. This RESTful API provides information on the Pokémon, including their names, heights, weights, images, and more.

### Prettier and ESLint

Prettier is employed to format the code correctly and highlight any code style errors in JS, CSS, and HTML. ESLint is used to detect functionality errors in JavaScript.

### Other Dependencies

Additional dependencies include the PokeAPI for data retrieval and the use of an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to encapsulate most of the functionality in the JavaScript file.
