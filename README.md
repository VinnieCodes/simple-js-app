OBJECTIVE - To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

SUMMARY 
1. My role in this project was to create the front-end of a web app that would display statistics of 150 pokemon, including name, image, and height. 
2. One decision I took was using Bootstrap. This was used to provide a user-friendly layout, without the bulk of many css attributes. One of the consequences is the lack of customizability.
3. If I could do one thing differently, I would add a search in the navbar that would allow the user to search for a specific pokemon.
4.  Lessons I learned include using an external API, Bootstrap, Immediately invoked function expressions, and much more.
